Test Plan:

    1. Introduction:
        This test plan is designed to test IMDB's Advanced Title Search version 2.8 functionalities and features.
        Specifically, the following fields: 
        Title, Title Type, Release Date, User Rating and Number of Votes.

        The rest of the features which will not be tested are given with their default value. Include:
        Genres, Title Groups, Title Data, Companies, Instant Watch Options, US Certificates, Color Info, Countries, Keyword, Languages, Filming Locations, 
        Popularity, PlotCast/Crew, Runtime, Sound Mix, Your Ratings, In Theaters, Adult Titles, Display Options.

        Bugs if any are found, will be saved onto our bug tracking system (JIRA). 

        Responsabilities:
            QA engineer (executer) - Markg - Will execute manual/automated tests that are attached to this test plan and report a log file to Veronica
            QA Manager (Team leader) - Veronicak - Will receive log file if any bugs are found, decide how to continue (RnD, fixes in the qa department, changing the test plan)

    5. Test approaches:
        Testing will be executed manually and black box. As per choice, for testing data we will be implementing according to equivalent classes and rules.
        The process of creating test scenarios we will use the technique of State-Transition. In order to save time, for regression testing we will gradually
        automate the basic and stable functionalities and features.
        When receiving a new build for testing, we will always start with Smoke Tests. 
    
    6. Pass/Fail Item criteria (Acceptance criteria):
        In the process of testing items, that are not in state: Not Fixed, defects with priorities such as:
        Blocker, Major, Critical and medium. The item must contain no defects in it's testing to continue.
        Every item needs to be tested in a minimum of 3 environments (ex. Android 12.1, IOS 8.6, Windows 10).
    
    7. Suspension/Resumption criteria:
        If the new build does not pass Smoke testing successfully - We will suspend the process of testing the new build.
        If the new build passed Smoke testing, but we are experiencing performance issues, with the new build, compared to the old one.
        Could be: crashes, unstable build in general. For example, crashing more than it used to crash before. Or, if we have more than 2 defects with priority: Blocker
        we will suspend the testing as well.
    
    8. Tester tasks: 
        Testers will write test documentation ( Test plan, Test case, Checklists), once a week a test report will be generated and delivered.
        When finding defects, testers will inspect and monitor them, also they will track and log the results in the Bug Tracking System.
    
    9. Environmental needs:
        In a form of hardware or software, to implement the section where we described a need for minimum 3 environments:
        Android, IOS and windows should be provided in some form or another.
    
    10. Staff and training needs:
        Access to backend results(searched queries API of some sort).
    
    11. Test delivarables:
        Produce a test report with metrics according to their respective priorities for the bugs that we have detected. We will also provided
        detailed checklists that describe how exactly we tested, in what environments and which functionalities we are testing. A full list of 
        the detected bugs, where you can see which feature/functionality is related to the specific defect will all be presented in our Bug Tracking system.
        // Automation prerequisits.
    
    12. Schedule:
        04/04/2023 - Requirements Analysis + Test design 
        05/04/2023 - First testing session + Regression testing
        06/04/2023 - Receiving tests and results + submitting project
    
    13. Risks:
        If until the 05/04/2023 we will not receive a new build, the process will not be completed, as we do not have enough time to test.
